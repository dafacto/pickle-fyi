title: Who runs Pickle Finance?
intro: Pickle is an anonymous organization, guided through community governance.
---

The Pickle Finance project was conceived and launched by a number of anonymous developers, inspired by the innovative ground broken by Yearn Finance, but focused on providing a more cohesive user experience.

The Pickle founders knew, however, that the best crypto projects are community led, and so a governance system was implemented beginning with proposal discussions on the [Pickle Forum](https://forum.pickle.finance), followed by voting on the [Snapshot platform](https://snapshot.page/#/pickle). These proposals then guide the direction in which the development team evolve the platform.

Finally, one of the most vibrant communities in DeFi has emerged around Pickle Finance, primarily at the [project Discord](http://discord.gg/gR85hmC). If you’re excited about Pickle, we’d love for you to join the conversation!

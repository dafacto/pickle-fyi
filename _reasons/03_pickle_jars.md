intro: Pickle Jars are products that generate yield for users, while working to keep assets on peg.

Whereas Pickle Farms allow users to earn PICKLE tokens by depositing assets, **Pickle Jars** allow users to access *yield-generating strategies* of arbitrary sophistication!

For example, Uniswap is currently conducting a farming activity, awarding UNI tokens to those who deposit into any of four particular liquidity pools, three of which relate to USD stablecoins. 

In response, Pickle Finance introduced its *0.69 series* Jars. When users deposit their Uniswap LP tokens into these Jars, the Jars will periodically harvest the available UNI tokens, sell them on the open market, and purchase additional LP tokens on behalf of the user!

And it gets even better! When a user deposits Uniswap LP tokens in a Pickle Jar, they receive back “pUNI-LP” tokens in receipt, which they can then deposit into a Pickle Farm, in order to *additionally* earn Pickle! 

At the time of this writing, with the USDC Pickle Jar earning 40% APY, and the USDC Pickle Farm earning about 40%, a Pickle user can earn a whopping 80% APY by participating in Uniswap’s farming program, combined with Pickle Finance!

Now let's consider the question on everybody's mind, [should I own some PICKLEs? →](/get-pickle/)

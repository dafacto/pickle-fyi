### Pickle Jars

Pickle Jars allow users to deposit tokens from liquidity pools such as Uniswap, and then execute sophisticated strategies that benefit the depositor. For example, the series 0.69 Jars auto-harvest the Uniswap UNI token, sell those tokens, and purchase more Uniswap liquitidy tokens on behalf of the user.

The Jars retain 4.5% of earned profits, which goes to the Pickle Treasury, and the displayed APY figures are net of fees. There is also a 0.5% withdrawal fee, a portion of which is distributed to Pickle Stakers (see below).

### Pickle Farms

Pickle Farms allow users to deposit a variety of tokens, and earn PICKLE tokens, which they can harvest at any time. Currently, there are two types of farms—one that provides a generous allocation of PICKLE rewards to participants of the PICKLE/ETH liquidity pool at Uniswap, and secondly, farms which allow Pickle Jar users to *additionally* earn PICKLE!

### Pickle Staking

People who stake their PICKLE tokens at Pickle Finance receive a proportionate share of the Jars’s 4.5% performance fees.

title: What are Pickle Farms?
intro: Pickle Farms are products that allow users to earn the PICKLE token, while helping crypto assets remain on peg.

Pickle Finance provides **Farms** that allow users to earn the PICKLE token in exchange for depositing certain assets. This image shows three farms into which users can deposit the “LP tokens” they receive when providing liquidity at exchanges such as Uniswap.

As you can see, the Annual Percent Yield (APY) across all three of these Farms is attractive, but is higher for those liquidity pools with tokens that are slightly off peg, thereby incentivizing Pickle users to provide liquidity to those particular pools.

In order to access one of these particular Farms, a user would provide liquidity at Uniswap—say, by depositing ETH and USDT in equal amounts—and then depositing the Uniswap LP tokens received in return, into the Pickle Farm, at which point the user begins receiving PICKLE tokens that can be claimed at any time!

There's one **special Farm** which incentivizes users to provide liquidity at Uniswap for the PICKLE/ETH pair. This product pays a very high APY, and helps provide PICKLE liquidity to the market.

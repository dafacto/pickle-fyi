title: Who runs Pickle Finance?
intro: Pickle Finance is an anonymous organization, guided through community governance.
---

The Pickle Finance project was conceived and launched by a number of anonymous developers, inspired by the ground broken by Yearn Finance, and focused on the specific need of keeping pegged assets pegged.

The Pickle founders knew, however, that the best crypto projects are community led, and so a governance system was implemented through the [Snapshot platform](https://snapshot.page/#/pickle). There, community-led proposals are posted on voted on, and these signals guide the direction in which the development team evolve the platform.

In addition, one of the most vibrant communities in DeFi has emerged around Pickle Finance, primarily at the [project Discord](http://discord.gg/gR85hmC). If you're excited about Pickle, we'd love for you to join the #PickleArmy!

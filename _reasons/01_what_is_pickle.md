intro: Pickle is a platform that incentivizes the maintenance of crypto asset pegs through yield-generating products.
---

Crypto is full of assets whose values are “pegged” to other assets, the most common  being  stablecoins such as USDC, USDT and DAI, which should be pegged to one US Dollar. 

Sometimes assets get off-peg, say, when DAI is $1.02, and that’s where Pickle Finance comes in. Through yield dynamics, Pickle Finance incentivizes market behavior to help off-peg assets get back on peg. For example, if DAI is off-peg, Pickle will increase the yield on its DAI-based products, incentivizing the purchase of DAI.

Currently, Pickle Finance offers two products—**Jars** and **Farms**—which are accessed by connecting an Ethereum wallet like Metamask to the [Pickel Finance](https://pickle.finance) platform.

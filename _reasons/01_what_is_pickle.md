### Off peg bad. On peg good!

There are many assets in the crypto space whose values are “pegged” to other assets; the most common being  stablecoins such as USDC, USDT and DAI, which are intended to be pegged to one US Dollar. 

Sometimes assets get off-peg, say, when DAI is $1.02, and that’s where Pickle Finance helps. Through yield dynamics, Pickle Finance incentivizes market behavior to help off-peg assets get back on peg. For example, if DAI is off-peg, Pickle will increase the yield on its DAI-based products, incentivizing the purchase of DAI.

Pickle Finance offers a suite of products which are accessed by connecting an Ethereum wallet like Metamask to the [Pickel Finance](https://app.pickle.finance) platform.

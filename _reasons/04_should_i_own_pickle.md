title: How do I get some Pickles?
intro: You can earn ’em, or you can buy ’em.

Folks interested in getting their hands on some Pickle can do so in a couple of ways:

1. You can [buy them directly on Uniswap](https://uniswap.info/pair/0xdc98556Ce24f007A5eF6dC1CE96322d65832A819). If you need to manually add the PICKLE token, its contract address is 0x429881672B9AE42b8EbA0E26cD9C73711b891Ca5

2. You can [deposit both ETH and PICKLE on Uniswap](https://uniswap.info/pair/0xdc98556Ce24f007A5eF6dC1CE96322d65832A819) (yes, you’d obviously need to have some PICKLE at that point), and then stake your UNI-LP tokens in the Pickle Farm to earn PICKLEs.

3. You can [participate in Uniswap’s farming program](https://app.uniswap.org/#/uni), deposit your UNI-LP tokens in a Pickle Jar, and then stake your Jar pTokens in a Farm to earn additional PICKLES! Here’s a [procedure how to do that](/pages/uniswap-pickle/).

And for those wondering about holding the Pickle token, we of course can’t offer investing advice, but here’s a few thoughts published by other investors.

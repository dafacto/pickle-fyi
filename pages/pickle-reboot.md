## Pickle & Yearn Strategic Collaboration

*Status: Draft. There may be errors and omissions*

In November 2020, Pickle and Yearn, two projects in the DeFi space dedicated to providing yield on customer deposits, agreed to enter a strategic collaboration. 

This article will describe the implications of this collaboration, in a brief, bullet-note format, including some contextual information to help fill in the conceptual gaps.

1. Pickle and Yearn have agreed to a strategic collaboration.
3. Yield-earning strategies, formally known as Pickle Jars, will be developed as Yearn “vaults”, and will benefit from all the security, collaboration and reputation of the Yearn ecosystem.
4. Whereas Pickle Jar depositors formerly paid 27.5% of their profits to the Pickle project, known as the “performance fee”, in the future, Yearn Vault depositors will pay a 20% performance fee, plus a 2% per year AUM (assets under management, independent of profit) fee, to the Yearn project.
5. Anyone can create a Yearn Vault strategy, and such creators are called “Strategists”. Strategists are entitled to 10% of profits earned on the operation of the Vault, which is half of the 20% performance fee.
6. Pickle Farms will continue, and will award newly minted PICKLE tokens to customers of Yearn vaults who deposit their vault receipts, "yTokens", into a Pickle Farm.
8. Which Yearn Vaults will have Pickle Farms, how those Farms are incentivized through emissions, and how fees may be shared between Yearn and Pickle, are questions that remain open to be resolved.
9. Pickle Jars will no longer exist in their current form, and the term “Pickle Jar” will apply to a new place where PICKLE holders can deposit their tokens to earn benefits.
10. Holders of the PICKLE token can “lock” their tokens in the Pickle Jar, for fixed terms, in a similar way that people lock US dollars in CDs (certificates of deposit). These terms may range from 1 week to 4 years.
11. When PICKLE tokens are locked in the Pickle Jar, the depositor receives a receipt in return, called a DILL. 
12. Holders of DILL are allowed to participate as voters in Pickle’s governance system. Most critical decisions regarding the Pickle project will be subject to vote, for example, the particular amount of Pickle emissions distributed to each Yearn vault.
13. Holders of DILL tokens who also are depositors in Pickle Farms will receive a “boost” of their PICKLE earnings, up to 250% depending on how many DILL tokens they have, and for how long they lock them. 
14. A calculator may be added to the Pickle Finance site to assist in understanding how variables, such as DILL amount and lock duration, affect earning boosts.
16. The source of Pickle income could come from either or both of fees charged to depositors of yTokens in Pickle Farms, or profit sharing on Vault income earned by Yearn. How this income will be allocated to DILL holders and the Pickle project itself, i.e. Treasury and Developer Fund, remains an open question, and it's expected will be decided through Pickle governance.
17. Finally, a new token called CORNICHON will be created and issued pro-rata to affected depositors in the exploited Pickle Dai Jar. 
18. The Pickle community will propose, discuss and vote on a mechanism by which that debt token will be used to compensate affected Dai Jar depositors.

>  Still working with the white hats to 100% verify that the other Jars are safe (though the prevailing thought right now is yes) and working with the forensics company to track the flow of funds and to hopefully recover

## Summary

On November 21, 2020, a malicious actor exploited the Pickle “Jar Swap”, a feature that allows users to swap funds between Pickle Jars. By impersonating a Pickle Jar, the exploiter was able to move the funds from the DAI Jar into [this Ethereum address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x70178102aa04c5f0e54315aa958601ec9b7a4e08).

A working group of some the industry’s best security experts was formed, and is currently investigating. While this is ongoing, the Pickle team is advising everyone to remove their funds. [See this tweet for instructions.](https://twitter.com/picklefinance/status/1330256787002564610?s=21)

The Pickle team is monitoring the stolen funds, and has engaged a forensics company to assist with the investigation.

## Summary

On November 21, 2020, a malicious actor exploited the Pickle Jar Swap, a feature that allows users to swap funds between Pickle Jars. The exploit was not a flash loan; rather, the malicious actor was able to impersonate a Pickle Jar, and exploit the Jar Swap feature to move the DAI Jar funds there.

A working group of the industry's best smart contract security experts was formed and is currently investigating. Since the exploit can potentially apply to all Jars, the Pickle team is advising everyone to remove their funds. [See this tweet for instructions.](https://twitter.com/picklefinance/status/1330256787002564610?s=21)

The malicious actor stole nearly all the funds in the DAI Jar, and moved them to [this Ethereum address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x70178102aa04c5f0e54315aa958601ec9b7a4e08). The Pickle team is monitoring this address, and has engaged a forensics company to assist with the investigation.
